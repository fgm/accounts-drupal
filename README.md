# Accounts-drupal

This is an accounts package for Meteor 1.2 to 1.6, using Drupal sessions transparently:

- The Meteor app is configured to use a specific Drupal server for sessions
- Any user with a session on the Drupal server is automatically logged in on Meteor, without any UI-level intervention
- Switching from anonymous to authenticated (and vice-versa) on Drupal automatically refreshes the status on connected Meteor applications
- Changes in the Drupal user account fields and roles reflects in real-time on connected Meteor applications.
- No dependency on [Drupal DDP] nor any intervening `ddp.js` Node server.


## Requirements

- Meteor 1.2.x to 1.6.x
- Drupal 8.0.x to 8.4.x
- The Drupal [meteor module] from FGM's Github, not to be confused with the existing [meteor sandbox] from drupal.org.
- The cookie domain for the Meteor application *must* be the same or a subdomain of the Drupal site. This is a consequence of [cookie scope]. Using the same domain on different IP ports works.
- If the Template package is present, Blaze helpers will be available, but it is 
  no longer a requirement.

### Updaters note

Since 0.2.6: if you disabled update buffering on the client using code like 
the fragment below to support Meteor 1.3.3 and later with earlier versions of 
this package which relied on `arunoda:streams` or the `fgm:streams` fork, this 
is no longer needed:

    Meteor.startup(function () {
      Meteor.connection._bufferedWritesInterval = 0;
    });

The package now uses `rocketchat:streamer` instead, so you *should* remove this
line to take advantage of the buffered writes present since Meteor 1.3.3.

# Running tests

The package can be tested once added to an application. Note that the `test-packages` command needs a `--settings` argument like a normal application launch. This can be the example settings file from the package.

    cd <your application>
    meteor add accounts-drupal

    # Run the package test suite. Assuming the package has been installed
    #Â locally, you can use its example.settings.json, otherwise use yours.
    meteor test-packages fgm:accounts-drupal --settings packages/accounts-drupal/example.settings.json

    # Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to observe the test results.

Remember not to have a running instance of the application already using port 3000.
